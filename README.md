## Definition
Project for TSOHA course.  
Online cookbook. Usage is for keeping inventory and creating recipes that are shard with all.
The main idea is to have **what can I currently make** search, which can be used with the user specific inventory which needs to be updated to work as intended.
Users can also search recipes with keyword search, works also without logging in.
