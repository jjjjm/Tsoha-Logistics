## Definition
Project for TSOHA course.  
Online cookbook. Usage is for storing recipes, keeping inventory and possible sharing them with other users.  
The main idea is to have **what can I currently make** search, which can atleast be used with the user specific inventory which needs to be updated to work.
Possible addition to this is non inventory needing search where user can just do keyword search with specific ingredients and the site will give recipes that are currently avaible for the user (Maybe no login needed implementation). 

## User stories
    - User can create an account
    - User can login
    - Site has admin accounts
    - User can add new ingredients to their inventory
    - User can keep track of their current cooking ingredient inventory.
    - User can add recipes to their own recipe book
    - User can access other users public recipes (User cannot access non-public recipes / recipes they don't own)
    - User can see what they can currently make recipes with the ingredients they currently have
    - User can search recipes they can currently make by listing abstract ingredients (no need to have them in inventory)
    - User can add pictures to recipe when its created
    - Users can add pictures to any recipes
    - User can see what they are currently missing from their inventory if they want to cook given recipe
